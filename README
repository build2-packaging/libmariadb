MariaDB is an open-source, multi-threaded, relational database management
system  with libmariadb being its C library. Applications can use this library
to pass queries to MariaDB and MySQL database servers, and to receive the
results of those queries using the C programming language. For more information
see:

https://mariadb.com

This package contains the original libmariadb library source code overlaid with
the build2-based build system and packaged for the build2 package manager
(bpkg).

See the INSTALL file for the prerequisites and installation instructions.

Send questions, bug reports, or any other feedback about the library itself to
the MariaDB mailing lists. Send build system and packaging-related feedback to
the packaging@build2.org mailing list (see https://lists.build2.org for posting
guidelines, etc).

The packaging of libmariadb for build2 is tracked in a Git repository at:

https://git.build2.org/cgit/packaging/mariadb/
